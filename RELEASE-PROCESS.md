# Release Process Guide

```

### 4. Update README.md

## üöÄ Release Execution

### 6. Version Update Process

#### Option A: Automated Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Use the automated version update script
./scripts/update-version-simple.sh NEW_VERSION

# Example:
./scripts/update-version-simple.sh 1.0.3
```

#### Option B: Manual Version Updates
If automated script fails, update manually:

**Files to update** (replace `OLD_VERSION` with `NEW_VERSION`):
- [ ] `leadgen-app-form.php` (Line ~4): `Version: NEW_VERSION`
- [ ] `leadgen-app-form.php` (@version): `@version NEW_VERSION`
- [ ] `includes/*.php` (@version): `@version NEW_VERSION`
- [ ] `assets/css/*.css` (@version): `@version NEW_VERSION`
- [ ] `assets/js/*.js` (@version): `@version NEW_VERSION`
- [ ] `blocks/**/*.js` (@version): `@version NEW_VERSION`

### 7. Verify Version Consistency
```bash
# Check all versions are consistent
./scripts/check-versions.sh
```

### 8. Commit Documentation Changes
```bash
# Commit documentation updates first
git add CHANGELOG.md README.md
git commit -m "üìö Update documentation for v1.0.3 release"
git push origin main
```

### 9. Create Release Tag
```bash
# Create and push the release tag
git tag v1.0.3
git push origin v1.0.3
```

## ü§ñ Automated Release Process

### 10. GitHub Actions Execution
After pushing the tag, GitHub Actions will automatically:

- [ ] ‚úÖ Update version numbers in all files
- [ ] ‚úÖ Extract changes from CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] ‚úÖ Generate RELEASE-NOTES.md
- [ ] ‚úÖ Create distribution package (~38KB)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Create GitHub Release with download links
- [ ] ‚úÖ Upload package artifacts
